// In this file I made change in database and checked the UI if all changes occurred.
Feature: End2End Database and UI Verifications

    // The step in Background are common first step for ALL scenarios.
    Background:
        Given I am on the Airtable database
        And I click "expand record" button under "object_id" section


    Scenario-1: Verify that the changes "CLASSIFICATION" and "STATUS" in Airtable occurs on UI
        When I select a classification(blank or positive or negative or neutral) and a status(blank or visible or hidden)
        Then I should see the same classification and the same status for that comment on UI


    Scenario-2: Verify that the changes "PLATFORM" in Airtable occurs on UI
        When I select a platform(blank or facebook or instagram)
        Then I should see the same platform logo for that comment on UI


    Scenario-3: Verify that the changes in "MESSAGE" section Airtable occurs on UI
        When I write a new message under "MESSAGE" section
        Then I should see the same message for that comment on UI


    Scenario-4: Verify that the changes in "AUTHOR_NAME" and "AUTHOR_USERNAME" section Airtable occurs on UI
        When I write a new author name under "AUTHOR_NAME" and a author username "AUTHOR_USERNAME"
        Then I should see the same author name and author username for that comment on UI




    /* NOTE:
    1-  When I change the platform from Airtable, it also changes on UI.
        So I am not familiar with the app, so I need feedbacks to consider if it is a bug or not.

    2-  When I change author name and author username from Airtable, it also changes on UI.
        So I am not familiar with the app, so I need feedbacks to consider if it is a bug or not.
