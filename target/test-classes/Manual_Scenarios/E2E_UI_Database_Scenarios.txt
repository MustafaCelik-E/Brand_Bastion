    // All 3 steps in Background are common first 3 steps for ALL scenarios.
    Background:
          Given I am on the login page
          And I logged in successfully with a valid key
          And I am on the Comments page


    Scenario-1: Verify the processed comment has saved with a classification and status in the Airtable
            When I process a comment by choosing a classification(positive or negative or neutral) and a status(visible or hidden)
            Then I should see the same classification and the same status for the processed comment on the Airtable


    Scenario-2: Verify that a processed comment can be updated with a classification and status in the Airtable
            And I process a comment by choosing a classification(positive or negative or neutral) and a status(visible or hidden)
            And I should see the same classification and the same status for the processed comment on the Airtable
            When I process the same comment again with different classification and a status values
            Then I should see the updated classification and status for the processed comment on the Airtable


    Scenario-3: Verify the processed comment has saved with only classification not status in the Airtable
            When I process a comment by choosing only classification(positive or negative or neutral) and not status
            Then I should see the same classification and blank status for the processed comment on the Airtable


    Scenario-4: Verify the processed comment has saved with only status not classification in the Airtable
            When I process a comment by choosing only status(visible or hidden) and not classification
            Then I should see the same status and blank classification for the processed comment on the Airtable


    Scenario-5: Verify the processed comment has saved without classification and status in the Airtable
            When I process a comment by not choosing neither classification nor status
            Then I should see the blank classification and blank status for the processed comment on the Airtable


    /* NOTE:
    When I perform manual testing, I can click "PROCESS" button without selecting any
    "Classification" and "Status" options and when I check the database, I see that
    processed comment is stored at the database without a valid classification and
    a valid status. As far as I understand the app, we need to store the processed
    comments with a valid classification and a valid status. Maybe we need to discuss
    about the requirements.
