Summary: Once a comment is processed, the status can not be updated on Airtable database later.


Description:

    Step-1: Given I am on the login page
        Step-1 --> PASSED

    Step-2: And I logged in successfully with a valid key
        Step-2 --> PASSED

    Step-3: And I am on the Comments page
        Step-3 --> PASSED

    Step-4: And I process the second comment by choosing "neutral" as classification and "hidden" as status
        Step-4 --> PASSED

    Step-5: And I should see the same "neutral" as classification and "hidden" as status for the processed comment on the Airtable
        Step-5 --> PASSED

    Step-6: When I process the same comment again with "positive" as classification and "visible" as status
        Step-6 --> PASSED

    Step-7: Then I should see the updated classification and status for the processed comment on the Airtable
        Step-7 --> FAILED


Expected Result : status = visible      classification = positive

Actual Result   : status = hidden       classification = positive
